# 🧹 Task 1: Data Preprocessing

## 🎯 Objective
Prepare a real-world dataset for AI modeling by performing **data cleaning, normalization, encoding, and splitting** operations using **Pandas** and **Scikit-learn**.

---

## 🧠 Overview
This task is part of the **Artificial Intelligence Hands-on Series**.  
The goal is to understand the **importance of data preprocessing** — the foundation of any Machine Learning workflow.

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. **Import Libraries** – pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn.  
2. **Load Dataset** – used the Iris dataset from sklearn.  
3. **Handle Missing Values** – replaced nulls with column mean.  
4. **Encode Categorical Variables** – converted text to numerical values.  
5. **Feature Scaling** – standardized features using `StandardScaler()`.  
6. **Data Splitting** – divided data into 80% training and 20% testing.  
7. **Visualization** – plotted feature distributions for better insight.
