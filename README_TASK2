# 🤖 Task 2: Machine Learning Model

## 🎯 Objective
Build, train, and evaluate **Machine Learning models** using **Scikit-learn**.  
This task demonstrates how to use algorithms such as **Decision Tree** and **Logistic Regression** for classification tasks.

---

## 🧠 Overview
This task is part of the **Artificial Intelligence Hands-on Series**.  
The goal is to understand **supervised learning workflows** — training a model, testing it, and evaluating its accuracy.

The **Iris dataset** (from sklearn) is used for simplicity and visualization.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Loaded the Iris dataset.
   - Normalized feature values using `StandardScaler()`.

2. **Model Building**
   - Trained two ML models:
     - 🌳 **Decision Tree Classifier**
     - 🤖 **Logistic Regression Classifier**

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated models using:
     - Accuracy Score
     - Classification Report
     - Confusion Matrix
   - Compared both models’ performances.

4. **Visualization**
   - Plotted confusion matrices and accuracy comparison chart.
